This is a little demo project to show how a combination of a [akka-streams](http://www.lightbend.com/activator/template/akka-stream-scala),
 [Reactive Kafka](https://github.com/akka/reactive-kafka), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and ElasticSearch can be used as the ingestion part
 of a fast data system.

#Setup
First you will have to set up a Kafka/Zookeeper combo and a working Elasticsearch node.
